        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          I specialize in building backend solutions that simplify manual processes — such as extracting structured data from Excel files, integrating with services like Google Drive, and transforming raw inputs into clean SQL-ready formats. I work mostly with Java (Spring Boot), Node.js, SQL, and Docker to create modular, maintainable systems.

        I enjoy creating internal tools, automating repetitive tasks, and deploying containerized applications that solve real-world problems. My focus is always on practical, clean, and reliable solutions that improve the way people work.</p>

        <p>
        Tech Stack & Tools:
        Java, Spring Boot, Node.js, SQL, Docker, Git, Google Drive API, Apache POI, Excel automation, basic Next.js, Prometheus/Grafana (learning)
        </p>

        <p>     
        Interests:
        Backend development, workflow automation, internal tools, system integration </p>

        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Projects</h2>

        <p>
          I’ve worked on projects in backend development, data automation, internal tools, file-based workflows, API integration, and lightweight DevOps. These include automating routine processes, managing structured data, deploying containerized services, and building efficient systems that support scalable digital operations across various environments and small-to-mid scale business needs. </p>

        <h2>🏆 Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
        I have successfully automated data workflows involving Excel, SQL, and backend systems, developed modular backend services for structured data processing, and integrated external APIs such as Google Drive for dynamic file handling. I’ve built internal tools to improve operational efficiency, created lightweight DevOps pipelines using Docker, and independently delivered several small-to-mid scale backend projects with clear documentation and version control, while continuously exploring best practices in system design, monitoring, and deployment.
